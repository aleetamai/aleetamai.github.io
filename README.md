## Research Interests:

My main research interest are on metric geometry, Morse theory and optimal transport for data analysis and machine learning.   |
                                                                                                                               |

Other interests cover differential topology, Riemannian and subRiemannian geometry, real algebraic geometry and Lie groups.
